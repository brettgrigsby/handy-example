# react-handy-example

This is a really basic example of using the `react-handy` library to represent a hand of cards.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Hit the `Add Random Card` to add a random card from the set to your hand.

Click any card to execute its on click function. In the case of this example app, it just
removes the card from your hand.
